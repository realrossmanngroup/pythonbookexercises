This is the program from chapter 8 of head first programming, with a few tweaks. 

1. The original program doesn't allow you to change the depots.txt file. Let's say new depots opened, you would have to X out of the program, edit depots.txt, and reload the program. We should be able to add depots to the list by clicking 'Add depots', and clear out old depots by hitting clear all'

2. The program scales based on the resolution of your monitor. The original program looked horrifically unreadable on my screen as the book suggests you write it.
