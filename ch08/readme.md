This is the program from chapter 8 of head first programming, with a few tweaks. 

1. The original program doesn't allow you to change the depots.txt file. Let's say new depots opened, you would have to X out of the program, edit depots.txt, and reload the program. We should be able to add depots to the list by clicking 'Add depots', and clear out old depots by hitting clear all'

2. The program scales based on the resolution of your monitor. The original program looked horrifically unreadable on my screen as the book suggests you write it. 

headex_dropdown.py is the final program. 

ch08_headex_radiobuttons.py is an earlier, easier implementation from earlier in the chapter. depots.txt & depots2.txt are different files with depot information to import, and psuedocode was me typing out my thoughts for how to write it prior to writing the program. 

ch08_headex_thisdoesntworkandidontknowwhy.py includes questions on syntax issues with .pack() that work in the book, but not in real life, that I want to ask someone later. 

ch08_headex.py was the earliest version of the program from the beginning of the chapter.
